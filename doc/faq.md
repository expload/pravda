# Frequently Asked Questions

> That connection between Pravda and Ethereum?

There is no connection. Pravda is independent project with its own virtual machine and consensus.

> How can I mine your coins?

You can't for now. Currently Pravda is blockchain with explicit authority. In future we are planning to move to truly decentralized way of consensus. It will happen after feature list stabilization.
