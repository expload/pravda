# Node API

Node provides REST API to access the current blockchain status.

## Get the events generated by program
You can get the generated events by name and the address of the program where they were generated.

### Request

`GET api/public/events`

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Optional|Type|
|---|--|---|
|program|Yes|hex|
|name|Yes|string|
|transactionId|Yes|hex|
|offset|Yes|integer|
|count|Yes|integer|

### Response

The list of events' offsets, `transactionId`s, addresses, names and datas:
```
[
    {
        "offset": 0,
        "transactionId": "0123456789abcdef",
        "timestamp": <unix-timestamp (long) like 1565618724247>,
        "address" : "<address of the program emited event>",
        "name": "event-name",
        "data": "<some data from the first event>"                
    },    
    {
        "offset": 1,       
        "transactionId": "fedcba9876543210",
        "timestamp": <unix-timestamp (long) like 1565618724247>,
        "address" : "<address of the program emited event>",
        "name": "another-name"
        "data": "<some data from the second event>"               
    }
    ...
]
```

```
will return all events starting from offset 10

```

```
will return only first 20 events from offset 10

```
curl <api url>/api/public/events?transactionId=07c3271089cc86b21058d50cb72b82bf45c548b2
```
will return all events for given `transactionId`

```
curl <api url>/api/public/events?transactionId=07c3271089cc86b21058d50cb72b82bf45c548b2
```
will return all events for given `transactionId`

# Filtering by name

When `name` is specified the result is formed in the same manner 
as getting events **without** `name` and then filtering these events by `name` in memory. 
It means `offsets` can be inconsistent, some offsets may be skipped, for example 
we can get `1, 2, 5, 10, 100` series of offsets for some request.
