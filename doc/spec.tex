\section{Introduction}

THIS SPEC IS OUTDATED

As part of the Expload Project, Pravda VM is designed to solve challenges of the game industry in section of decentralization. The purpose of Pravda VM is programmatic management of global state of the network. We're offering minimalistic deterministic virtual machine and runtime library for managed execution of smart-contracts.

In our work we're focusing on simplicity and extensibility. We don't set ourselves a task to invent something new, but using solid foundation of computer science we consider requirements of the network.

This document specifies memory and execution model, bytecode format, start-contracts interop and definition of standard library (including procedures and data types). Also this document defines gas-economy. The document \textit{doesn't} consider issues of blockchain, consensus, network of storage. 

\section{Execution model}

\subsection{General}

Pravda VM is a stack-based virtual machine. All data is represented by string, so "machine word" is a string. Pravda VM can store words in a managed heap. Heap is inaccessible for raw reads/writes and fully managed by runtime. Heap has map-like interface where key is string of four bytes and value is an arbitrary string. 

Persistence is an integral part of Pravda VM which is a representation of a global state of the network. Persistent state has map-like interface as the heap. The difference is programmer can use arbitrary string as a key.

Code can be executed.
\subsection{Execution scopes}

Launched code is named execution. There are two execution scopes: transaction and smart-contract. If launched code is placed in a transaction it has \textit{transaction scope}. Similarly if launched code is placed in a smart-contract it has \textit{smart-contract scope}.

Execution in transactions scope has not persistent storage but has its own stack and heap. Execution in smart-contacts scope inherits both stack and heap from the execution which launches it. Also it has persistent storage shared between all the executions of the smart-contract.

\subsection{Transaction isolation}

As noted above persistence is an integral part of Pravda VM. Executions can read and write to the persistent storage. Pravda VM supports parallel execution of the same smart-contacts. It means concurrent access to the stored data. According to this requirement we need to provide highest level of consistency so transactions is isolated serializable\cite{transaction-isolation}. 

\section{Bytecode}

BVM executes bytecode in the format described below. Every program is a linear sequence of \textit{opcodes.md}. Any opcode is represented by one byte. Exception is "PUSHX" opcode which is represented by one byte for opcode itself and a word to represent a constant.

First 3 bits of the word encode length. This is the length of the length of the encoded data. For example, $256$ bytes of the data are encoded by the word of $258$ bytes , which are

$$\underbrace{010}_{3~bits}\underbrace{00001~00000000}_{5~bits~+~1~byte} \underbrace{\cdots}_{256~bytes} $$

If the length of the length is 0 the data is encoded by the rest $5$ bits of the byte.

\section{Watts}

Everything has a price. When you send your program to the Pravda blockchain, validators need to spend their resources (like electricity, disk space and memory) just to execute it. The more complex calculations you execute, the more validator's resources are needed. So, you should give them some kind of money for your program. Amount of \emph{Watts} is the representaion of spent resources in Pravda.

There are three main resources you use in Pravda - CPU time, memory and storage space. So, all of them has a cost in Watts, which are described below.

\emph{Watt price} $W_p$ is the cost of one spent watt. The more price you assign to the transaction the more probability that your transaction will be chosen by the validators.

\emph{Watt limit} $W_l$ is the limit of watts you think should be enough to execute your program. If it is actually not enough you will get OutOfWatts exception, your program will do nothing and you will pay for that transaction.

Before you execute a transaction, a fee of $W_p \cdot W_l$ Native Coins will be charged from your account. After the execution is complete, you will get back $W_p \cdot \theta$, where $\theta = W_l - W_s + \min(W_r, \frac{W_s}{2})$. Here $W_s$ - spent Watts and $W_r$ - refund Watts. 

All the rest Native Coins, which are $W_p \cdot (W_l - \theta)$, are shared among the validators after the block containing the transaction is committed.

\subsection{CPU time}

Every new opcode needs 1 Watt to be executed.

Every time you use storage we need time to read or write to it. So, it costs 20 Watts.

$$
C_s = \begin{cases} 
	20 & \text{if storage is used} \\
	0  & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
$$


There are several groups of operations that needs different omount of CPU time and therefore different amount of watts. They are:

$$
C_{extra} = \begin{cases} 
			5 & \text{for opcodes.md I32ADD,I32LT,I32GT,NOT,AND,OR,XOR,EQ} \\ % SimpleArithmetic
			5 & \text{for opcodes.md CALL,JUMP} \\ % Control
			10 & \text{for opcodes.md I32DIV,I32MUL,I32MOD,FDIV,FMUL,FMOD} \\ % Arithmetic
			10 & \text{for opcodes.md PCALL,LCALL} \\ % ExtCall
			15 & \text{for opcodes.md JUMPI} \\
			0 & \text{for other opcodes.md} \\
			\end{cases}
$$

CPU time watts for every opcode are calculates as:
$$ C_{op} = 1 + C_{s} + C_{extra} $$ 


So, total CPU time watts for the transaction are calculates as:

$$ C_w = \sum_{op} C_{op} $$ 

\subsection{Memory}

Memory in pravda consists of two main parts - stack and heap. PUSHX opcode allocates stack memory and MPUT opcode allocates heap memory. Pravda calculates maximum amount of bytes $b_m$ you spent during the transaction execution. Memory watts are calculated as:

$$M_w = 100\cdot(\lfloor b_m/100,000,000 \rfloor + 1)^3 $$

\subsection{Storage}

Every time you put something into the storage using SPUT or SDROP opcodes.md, pravda calculates amount of bytes you occupy $o_s$ and amount of bytes you release $r_s$. Total storage watts are calculates as:

$$S_w = 8 \cdot o_s $$

Refund is calculates as:
$$W_r = 2 \cdot r_s $$

\subsection{Total}

Total amount of spent watts is calculates as:

$W_s = C_w + M_w + S_w$
